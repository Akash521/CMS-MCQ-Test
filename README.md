# exam
We created CMS where user can appear for exam and admin can look after the question papers

First You have to download this exam rar file then that rar file look like this (exam-master.rar) and then you have to extract 
that rar file you have to rename or replace that folder name to (exam). 

after you have to create database in phpmyadmin or in mysql you have to create database name like this (quiz_new) name database 

if you have  any type of mention password in mysql or in phpmyadmin then you have to go in that project directory exam/install/config.php edit and change your databsae user name or password  
with whatever you mention in your mysql or phpmyadmin

and after that you have to move exam folder to that in linux : /var/www/html/  or in windows first download xammp  then paste that folder in /xampp/htdocs/ 

then run this link http://localhost/exam/install/index.php

now you have to put in first field databse name : quiz_new 
next field put : localhost 
after that you have  to fill your username and password then
you go to the next page  showing create admin  for the website create admin  username and password for that online examination system 
then you have to fill you admin user name and password then clik on checkbox login as admin
